# Cyclone-Frequency-Prediction
This project analyzes historical cyclone data from 1891 to 2019 for the Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea, and land areas, focusing on identifying patterns and predicting future cyclone occurrences. By applying machine learning techniques, the project aims to develop models capable of forecasting cyclone frequency for each month (October, November, December) within the cyclone season. The insights derived from this analysis will contribute to early warning systems and improved disaster preparedness.

Data Structure:

Year	October	November	December	Region
1891	0	0	0	Bay of Bengal
1891	0	1	1	Arabian Sea
1891	1	1	3	Land
